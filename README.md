# SpringScala

A little project to try a few things using Spring with Scala. Specifically:

* Programmatic Application Context `@Configuration`
* Logging
* `@Autowired`
* Manual access to the application context within the application
* Ivy dependency resolution

The point of this is try out a good mix of java, scala and spring for rapid development.
